# Crowbarella

This is just my personal set of [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)-based tools to refactor shitty C/C++ code.

Use at your own risk, have fun!

# Usage

1. Generate a [compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) (CMake has [CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS] for this)
2. Run `crowbarella`
